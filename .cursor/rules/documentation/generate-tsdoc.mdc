# Generating TSDoc Comments for AI-Mastra

Consistent and comprehensive TSDoc documentation is a requirement for the AI-Mastra project, as stated in the main `@file ssdeanx/ai-mastra/AI-Mastra-9c843c733026b19a01e114eec2aa377cf0ecb6d2/README.md` (see sections "API Documentation" and "Contributing"). This rule guides the AI in generating TSDoc that meets these standards whenever working with TypeScript files.

When asked to generate or complete TSDoc for a TypeScript code element (function, class, method, interface, type alias), ensure the following structure and tags are used:

## 1. Standard TSDoc Structure
A TSDoc comment block should immediately precede the code element it documents.

```typescript
/**
 * [Concise summary of the element's purpose and functionality.]
 *
 * [@remarks]
 * [Optional: More detailed explanation, usage notes, important considerations, or rationale.]
 *
 * [@example]
 * [Optional: A brief code example demonstrating usage.]
 *
 * [@param parameterName - Description of the parameter.]
 * [@returns Description of the return value, including its type if complex.]
 * [@throws {ErrorType} Description of conditions under which this error is thrown.]
 * [@see {@link relatedElement} or URL for further information.]
